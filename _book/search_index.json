Code to retreive lables is here: https://github.com/sul-dlss-labs/google-vision-ai Catal is project here: http://catalhoyuk.com SUL AI studio: https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/sul-ai-studio/ For various reasons we had some attrition and ended up with 766 images. Results shown here are based on those. 0.1 Comments, ideas in random order It could be useful for discoverability if the images are embedded in a much larger dataset, but not sure about within the image dataset itself. Instead of looking for positive identification turn it around and look for things that are NOT excavation or artifacts. For example, ‘buildig’ gets us images of the shelter. "]
